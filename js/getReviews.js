I hated that job and could go on with the list. It was nearly my 2 year anniversary there and I was still waiting to receive my 6mo evaluation raise, it took over 3 months to get my first year raise. The company re-enrolled me in their insurance (without asking) after forcing me to sign off my insurance when moving to casual from being a full time employee, and then refused to remove the re-enrolled insurance and continue to bill me for another year until the next open enrollment, with no access to the insurance I was billed for!",

I really enjoyed traveling to other Grand Openings. The management is really amazing at making promises. That's where is good ends. I had one great DM and once she was gone, the next 2 were absolutely horrible. 20 something year old kids that are given a position of power and they absolutely abuse it. The expectations by a DM are so far fetched. They themselves can't do the work that they are demanding. They are so unappreciative. Never once got a 'good job' or 'pat on the back'. Our store meetings were just a bashing session. The whole time was about what were doing wrong and what we needed to improve on even though we were meeting the expectations from prior week. You can forget about asking for a break. You were made to feel like breaks were a 'waste of time'. They say the pay is competitive with other stores but that was a lie. Although the pay figures were similar, the job tasks and requirements were not. At this company, you are not assigned to a specific task. Everyone did everything. They don't promote from within and no shift manager is full time at that position. Once the 'Grand Opening' stage is done, your hours are cut. You do the tasks of 3 people and get paid for one. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Well at least not the location I worked at.",
